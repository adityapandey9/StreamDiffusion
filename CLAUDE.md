1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/<task_name>.md.
2. The plan should implement solutions in organised structure, folder, file, variable names, test files, documentations.
3. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
4. Write test cases for every task you implement, validate the new implementations against existing functionality via running all the test cases, fix the issues if you found any.
5. Platform compatibility is maintained across all targets
6. Performance regressions can be detected early
7. Error conditions are properly handled
8. Data integrity is preserved under all conditions
9. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
10. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
11. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
12. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
13. Finally, add a review section to the <task_name>.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
